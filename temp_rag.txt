📅 Day 1: Introduction to Agentic AI
Concepts:
What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems capable of autonomous decision-making and action.
Components:
LLM (Large Language Model) — brain of the agent.
Memory — allows the agent to recall previous steps.
Tools/Environment — APIs, databases, or code execution tools.
Example:
Chatbot: “What is the weather in Delhi?” → replies with the answer.
Agent: “What’s the weather in Delhi, and should I carry an umbrella?” → searches, reasons, and provides an
actionable response.

Study Material:
OpenAI Docs: Introduction to Agents
YouTube: “What are AI Agents?” by LangChain (10-min intro)
📅 Day 2: LLM Fundamentals
Concepts:
Tokens: Small pieces of words processed by models.
Temperature: Controls randomness in output.
Top_p: Controls diversity of responses.
Context Window: Maximum number of tokens a model can remember.
Python Example:
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o-mini",
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain what an AI agent does in 3 
lines."}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
📅 Day 3: Prompt Engineering for Agents
Concepts:
System Prompts: Define the agent’s behavior.
Role Prompting: Assigns a role like “You are a planner.”
Chain-of-Thought Prompts: Encourage step-by-step reasoning.
Example:
prompt = """You are a planning assistant. Break down how to organize a 3-hour 
study session into focused tasks."""

📅 Day 4: LangChain Basics
Concepts:
Chains: Link LLMs and tools together.
Agents: Dynamically decide what action to take next.
Tools: Functions or APIs used by agents.
Example Code:
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description",
verbose=True)
response = agent.run("What is 25% of 240?")
print(response)
📅 Day 5: Adding Memory
Concepts:
Short-term Memory: Stores recent messages.
Long-term Memory: Uses vector databases for persistence.
Example Code:
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "Hello"}, {"output": "Hi there!"})
print(memory.load_memory_variables({}))

📅 Day 6: Multi-Agent Collaboration (CrewAI)
Concepts:
CrewAI: Enables multiple agents with roles to collaborate.
Agents can pass tasks and data between each other.
Example:
Two agents: 1. Researcher Agent → Collects data. 2. Writer Agent → Summarizes into reports.
Explore: CrewAI GitHub Repo
📅 Day 7: Planning & Reasoning Loops
Concepts:
Agents follow plan → act → observe → improve cycle.
Reflection improves agent accuracy.
Example Prompt:
prompt = """You are an autonomous agent. Plan how to study AI for 3 days. After 
planning, reflect on what could go wrong and fix it."""
Study:
Research "ReAct (Reason + Act) Framework" for Agents
📅 Day 8: Project Setup – Personal Study Assistant Agent
Goal:
Build an AI agent that: - Accepts your subjects and goals - Creates a daily study plan - Motivates you with
summaries
Setup Steps:
Install dependencies: 
pip install openai langchain

Set up your API key: 
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Create a file named study_agent.py
📅 Day 9: Project Code Walkthrough
Example Code:
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain, PromptTemplate
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)
prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["subject", "hours"],
template="""You are a study planner AI. Create a {hours}-hour study plan 
for {subject} with focus, break, and revision periods."""
)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
subject = input("Enter the subject: ")
hours = input("Enter available hours: ")
print("\nGenerated Plan:\n")
print(chain.run({"subject": subject, "hours": hours}))
Output Example:
Generated Plan:
1. 0-1 hr: Read core concepts
2. 1-1.5 hr: Practice key problems
3. 1.5-2 hr: Break
4. 2-3 hr: Revise + summarize

📅 Day 10: Deployment + Resume Integration
Deploy:
You can run the agent locally or deploy on: - Streamlit: For a quick web interface - Gradio: For interactive
app demo
Resume Line Example:
Built  a  Personal  Study  Assistant  Agent  using  LangChain  and  OpenAI  APIs,  capable  of
generating adaptive study plans using autonomous reasoning and prompt-driven logic.
GitHub Setup:
Create a repo named Agentic-AI-Study-Agent
Add README.md  with project description and screenshots
Include the study_agent.py  code
Next Steps:
Explore LangGraph for visual multi-agent workflows
Try building a Web Research Agent next!
